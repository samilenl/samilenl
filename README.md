### About Me
 
I have always had a passion for computer programming, and I have desired to become a developer ever since I was young - even though I didn't know it was an actual profession. However, my journey to becoming a developer has been a bumpy ride.

I remember trying to create my first game and feeling really excited about it. I'd watched a movie about some kids who built an app that took the world by storm. I was really motivated, and I decided to create my first game, but I soon realized that game development was not for me. So, I decided to leave all that behind, and focus on other things that I found more feasible, and so I tried my hand at different paths.
 
Although I pursued other interests, it all led me back here, my childhood desire of becoming a developer - crafting digital works from my heart..... through my hands..... to the world. I came to the realization that it was something that truly interested me and made me happy.

Now, as I continue down this path, I am motivated by the progress I have made and the knowledge I have gained. I am committed to honing my skills and becoming the best developer I can be. And I am excited to see where this journey will take me.
